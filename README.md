## Hi there 👋

I'm just a kid trying to make some cool programs. Feel free to check them out!

Here are some things about me! :)
- I love computers
- All animals are the best (insects are not animals)
- Windows is terrible (I use arch btw)
- Cats are the best

## Thank you for checking out my profile! :3
